# LearningAutomation

## Goals for this test automation project

* Learn Java and selenium, utilising Alan Richardson's course (see Credits)
* Incorporate tools / frameworks in order to practice what I am learning on current projects. These include:
    -   &#9989; JUnit tests (initially but switching) to Gherkin - in progress
    -   &#9989; Cucumber archetype required (for switching from JUnit to Gherkin)
    -   &#9989; Maven (initially but switching) to Gradle
    -   Gherkin
    -   Logging
    -   Page Object model
    -   Page Factory
    -   Jenkinsfile (for multibranch pipelines)
    -   YAML file for test data
    -   WebDriver Factory

## Running the tests
